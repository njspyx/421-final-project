Object Detection in Images/Videos via YOLOv8

We finetune a YOLOv8 model to:
* detect aircrafts
* detect and classify various vehicles

Dataset creation and model deployment is done via `Roboflow`. Visualization is done using the `supervision` module.

`model_finetuning.ipynb` contains scripts for model finetuning using Roboflow.
`421_final_GUI.ipynb` contains python UI to allow users to annotate images with bounding boxes and annotate videos with bounding boxes, traces, and heatmap.
